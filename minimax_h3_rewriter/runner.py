"""Running a llama.cpp executable once and reading its output as it arrives.

Shared by every subprocess backend in the pack: the rewriter drives
``llama-completion`` and the captioner drives ``llama-mtmd-cli``, but the part
that matters is identical and is the part that is easy to get wrong.

Four things are load-bearing:

- **stdin is closed, not inherited.** A child that can never block waiting for a
  key is one failure mode fewer, and ComfyUI's own stdin is not ours to read.
- **Decoding carries state.** Token pieces arrive as raw bytes and a multi-byte
  character can straddle two reads, so a per-chunk ``bytes.decode`` mangles any
  non-ASCII output.
- **Silence is timed.** Generous before the first byte, because loading tens of
  gigabytes from a cold disk legitimately takes minutes; short afterwards,
  because a model that has begun emitting and then stops for three minutes is
  not going to resume. Either way the node fails with a message instead of
  wedging the ComfyUI queue, which is what a subprocess that never exits does.
- **No child outlives the interpreter.** Every process started here is
  registered, and an ``atexit`` hook kills whatever is still holding VRAM.
